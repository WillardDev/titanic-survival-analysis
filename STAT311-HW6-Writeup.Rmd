### Preamble

There is some debate in statistical circles as to how to treat the survival data from the sinking of the Titanic. Some individuals view this data as representing a fixed event, with determined outcomes, describing a specific population exactly. Some consider it a single observation of potential ship sinkings of the time. For the purposes of this exercise we will consider the outcome of the sinking of the Titanic as a random observation of all possible outcomes, where the specifics of any individual's survival are dependent on many complex factors.

In such a context we test hypotheses against the hypothetical potential outcomes that could have occured under slightly different circumstances. In such a context we can compare this specific outcome against other potential outcomes utilizing the process of hypothesis testing to address questions about the underlying "population" of possible outcomes.

### Question 1 - Defining Hypotheses [3 points]

#### Using the Titanic dataset provided in the variable `titanic.data`, construct a table of the `Class` and `Survived` variables. Call this variable `titanic.table`

```{r table}
# Construct a table of the titanic.data variables Class and Survived
titanic.table = table(titanic.data$Class, titanic.data$Survived)

print(titanic.table)
```
We wish to conduct a chi-squared test for independence hypothesis test for this data set (and for these variables). 

#### What are the null and alternative hypotheses for this test? Be sure to define these in the specific context of this problem.
\
\
H<sub>0</sub>: "Null Hypothesis"

H<sub>a</sub>: "Alternative Hypothesis"

### Question 2 - Hypothesis Test [2 points]

#### Using the functions available in R, conduct a chi-squared test for independence test on the table previously created. Save this test as the variable `titanic.test`

```{r hypothesisTest}
# Save the results of the chisq.test in the variable titanic.test
titanic.test = chisq.test(titanic.table)
titanic.test
```

Consider the following table calculated for the hypothesis test.

```{r expectedTable}
print(titanic.test$expected)
```

#### Explain as if explaining to someone with moderate statistical knowledge what the table of values displayed above represents, contextualized to this specific hypothesis. Also, identify why (under the null hypothesis being true), the observed data does not match the table seen above (aside from not being whole numbers).

### Question 3 - P-value and conclusions [3 points]

```{r pValue}
print(titanic.test$p.value)
```

The code above reports the p-value for the hypothesis test. 

#### Explain as if explaining to someone with moderate statistical knowledge what the p-value represents in the context of the specific hypotheses being tested here.
\
\
"Response"

#### Based on the results of this study, what do you conclude from your hypothesis test? Be sure to frame your response in the context of the specific hypotheses being tested here.

### Question 4 - Other Considerations [2 points]

```{r otherConsider}
print(table(titanic.data$Class, titanic.data$AgeOrSex))
```

#### Consider the table of values above, which looks at the relationship between class and age or sex (for adults). Contextualizing with what was seen in the analysis during class, how might we consider the information above as it relates to the hypothesis test that we just conducted? IE: What relationships between variables must be considered for a more in depth analysis?
